Add a description of the program as a comment at top  
// This program is to see what side a coin flips.
// Head is true, while tails is false.
Add a list and description of Java built-in data types within the user interface or in comments  
// Types of Data and Ranges:
// Byte: -128 to 127
// Short: -32,768 to 32,767
// Integer: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1
// Long: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1
// Float: Range is beyond the scope.
// Double: Range is beyond the scope.
// Boolean: True or False values.
// Character: 0 to 65,535
// String: Non-numerical values (special support type).
Add a greeting / introduction to the user  
System.out.println("Check out this \"crazy\" project.");
Use a boolean variable with an appropriate name  (singular noun, lowerCamelCase)  
boolean bool1 = true;
  if (bool1 = true) {
      System.out.println(string1);
    if (bool1 = false) {
      System.out.println(double1);
Use an int variable with an appropriate name (singular noun, lowerCamelCase)  
    int int1 = 2;
    System.out.println((double)int1);
Use an double variable with an appropriate name (singular noun, lowerCamelCase)
boolean bool1 = true;
    int int1 = 2;
    double double1 = 2.0;
    System.out.println((double)int1);
    if (bool1 = false) {
      System.out.println(double1);
Use a String object with an appropriate name (singular noun, lowerCamelCase)
   int int1 = 2;
   String string1 = "2"; 
   if (bool1 = true) {
     System.out.println(string1)
Define (in English) the term "variable" as it relates to computer programming in a comment or the user interface
// A variable is a value that can change depending on the conditions or the
// information passed to the program.
Define (in English) the term "scope" as it relates to computer programming in a comment or the user interface  
// Scope is the visibility of variables.
Use final with a variable and describe what it means in a comment  
Use casting and describe what it means in a comment  
final int score = 100; 
    // The final keyword makes the variable a constant (it must be initialized)
    // Final int score = 100 means that the score will not pass the number 100
Format strings using escape sequences  
System.out.println("Check out this \"crazy\" project.");
